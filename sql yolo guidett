Now, to install MySQL on Ubuntu and Windows:

Ubuntu:

Open a terminal and update the package lists by running:
sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
Install MySQL Server by running:
arduino
Copy code
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
During the installation process, you will be prompted to set a root password for MySQL.

Start the MySQL service by running:

sql
Copy code
sudo service mysql start
Windows:

Download the MySQL installer from the official MySQL website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Choose the "Developer Default" installation type, which includes MySQL Server.

During the installation process, you will be prompted to set a root password for MySQL.

Start the MySQL service by opening the "Services" application (Press Win + R, then type services.msc and hit Enter), find "MySQL" in the list, and start the service.

After installing MySQL, you can create the database and table required by the code by running the following SQL commands:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE object_detection;

USE object_detection;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS detections (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  timestamp DATETIME,
  object_class VARCHAR(255)
);
Make sure to replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' in the Python code with your actual MySQL username and password.

Remember to have the YOLOv3-tiny weights (yolov3-tiny.weights), configuration file (yolov3-tiny.cfg), and class names file (coco.names) in the same directory as the Python code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
